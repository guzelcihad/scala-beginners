WHEN YOU NEED LOOPS, USE _TAIL_ RECURSION.

A tail-recursive function describes a function whose last action is a direct call to itself. 
When recursive functions are written this way, 
the Scala compiler can optimize the resulting 
JVM bytecode such that the function requires only one stack frame, 
as opposed to one stack frame for each level of recursion.

Regular recursion creates lots of stack frames, and for algorithms that 
require deep levels of recursion, this creates a StackOverflowError (and crashes your program).

When the Scala compiler spots a tail-recursive function, it knows
 to optimize it by essentially turning it into a while loop. This means there are no more recursive calls and no more frames pushed onto the stack.
